Use this README file to introduce your application and point to useful places in the API for learning more.
Run "rake appdoc" to generate API documentation for your models and controllers.

To start up this application use "cap deploy_with_migrations" because we need to regenerate the schema after every change.  This is because we use sqlite.  Could move to keep sqlite in the system directory soon.
